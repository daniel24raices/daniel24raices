      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am Daniel Raices. Born in 1993 in Caracas, Venezuela. Currently based in Madrid, Spain.<br>
        <br>I am a professional translator, Spanish is my mother tongue and I also speak English, French, and Italian.<br>
        <br>Recently, I have ventured into the world of front-end development. I am eager to absorb as much knowledge as possible and develop new skills. The transition from translation to coding may seem like a leap, but for me is a chance to merge my love for languages with my fascination for technology. The path ahead may be uncertain, but I am excited to embark on this journey of growth and discovery.<br>
